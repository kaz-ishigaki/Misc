# Random topics in statistics
I deposited several scripts and personal notes to answer random questions during my bioinformatics research.

## 1, L01_repeated_measurement: 
Should we use fixed effect or random effect to control repeated measurement?

## 2, L02_pvalue_distribution:
Practical examples of P value distributions in multiple null models.
